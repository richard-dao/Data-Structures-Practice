# Data-Structures-Practice
Abstract Data Types, Linear, Tree, Hash-Based, and Graph Structures

## Work in Progress (Self Teaching Data Structures)

Prerequisites from APCSA:
- Primative data types (integers, doubles, floats, booleans)
- Classes and Objects
- Loops and Conditionals
- Arrays, Lists, 2-D Arrays
- Binary Search
- Selection, Insertion, and Merge Sort
- Recursion and Inheritance

Prerequistes from Python:
- Python knowledge equivalent to Java
- Applied knowledge of sets, dictionaries, and tuples
